# About Replit

We have a "Deploy to Replit" button for those people that like Replit. We do not recommend using Replit.

<iframe src="https://hub.alienhub.xyz/show?utm_medium=amethystnetwork" scrolling="no" width="450" height="150"></iframe>

## Why is Replit bad for proxies?

- Hosting a unblocker is against their [Terms of Service](https://replit.com/site/terms). (Section 4 item 24)
- You WILL get banned if you choose to host a unblocker anyway
- It is SLOW
- Deployment takes a while
- Other services are faster and also way better

You are probably better off going <a onClick={() => window.history.back()}>back</a> and deploying this elsewhere.

Or, watch this video that may or may not help you:

## The Deploy Button

By clicking the below button, I Acknowledge that I have read and understood the above text.

<BrowserOnly>{() => {
  e();
  return (
    <>
      <span>For all we know, your IP could be </span><span title="it's public" ref={i}>0.0.0.0</span>
    </>
  )
}}</BrowserOnly>

<br />
<br />

<BrowserOnly>{() => (
  <a onClick={() => {
    const repo = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('repo');
    if(!repo) return alert('ERR! Something is wrong with your URL!');
    window.location = `https://repl.it/github/amethystnetwork-dev/${repo}`
  }}>
    <img src="https://amethystnetwork-dev.github.io/assets/replit.svg" />
  </a>
)}</BrowserOnly>
